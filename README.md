## More translators

Steer LLM outputs towards a certain topic/subject and enhance response capabilities using activation engineering by adding steering vectors, now in oobabooga text generation webui!

<https://github.com/Hellisotherpeople/llm_steer-oobabooga/tree/main>

## Virtual Lora

State of the Art Lora Management - Custom Collections, Checkpoints, Notes & Detailed Info

If you're anything like me (and if you've made 500 LORAs, chances are you are), a decent management system becomes _essential_. This allows you to set up multiple LORA 'collections', each containing one or more virtually named subfolders into which you can sort all those adapters you've been building for weeks; and add any notes about the LORAs or checkpoints. You can of course apply the LORAs or any of the checkpoints directly. It's a finer grained enhancement than Playground's Lora-rama, but it will be concentrating solely on LORAs and nothing else.

<https://github.com/FartyPants/VirtualLora>

## piper_tts

An extension for using [Piper](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper) text-to-speech (TTS) model for fast voice generation. The main objective is to provide a user-friendly experience for text generation with audio. This TTS system allows multiple languages, with quality-voices and fast synthesis (much faster than real-time).

<https://github.com/tijo95/piper_tts>

## Web_Search

This extension enables' a language model to receive google search data according to the users' input.[Currently supports google search only]

Simple way to do google searches through the webUI and the model responds with the results.

One needs to type search then what you want to search for, example:

Type `search the weather in Nairobi, Kenya today.`

<https://github.com/simbake/web_search>

## edge_tts

A simple implentation of Microsoft's free online TTS service using the [edge_tts](https://github.com/rany2/edge-tts) python library. Now supports RVC!

<https://github.com/BuffMcBigHuge/text-generation-webui-edge-tts>

## LibreTranslate

Offline translate using the LibreTranslate local server.

<https://github.com/brucepro/LibreTranslate-extension-for-text-generation-webui>

## CodeRunner

Make a code execution environment available to your LLM.
This extension uses thebe and a jupyter server to run code on.

<https://github.com/xr4dsh/CodeRunner>

## Playground for Writers

This extension provides an independent advanced notebook that will be always present from the top tab. It has many features not found in the notebook:

- Two independent Notebooks A and B that are always present, regardless of the mode
- Inline instruct (abilty to ask question or give task from within the text itself)
- Select and Insert - generate text in the middle of your text
- Perma Memory, Summarization, Paraphrasing
- LoRA-Rama - shows LoRA checkpoints and ability to switch between them
- LoRA scaling (experimental) - adjust LoRA impact using a sclider

<https://github.com/FartyPants/Playground>

## Ooba_Dieroller

A super simple extension that reads dice notation (eg. "2d6") from input text, and rolls a random result accordingly, feeding that into the prompt.
Features support for modifiers (eg. "2d6+4") and advantage/disadvantage.

<https://github.com/TheInvisibleMage/ooba_dieroller>

## Twinbook

This extension combines chat and notebook in a very clever way. It's based on my above extension (Playground) but very streamlined for only Generation/Continue but with a little twist. You are in full control of both sides - the instruction side (left) and the result side (right) allowing you to steer LLM in the middle of text (or even sentence) by simply changing the instructions on left and clicking Continue on right.
For more trips how to use it, read the README

<https://github.com/FartyPants/Twinbook>

## Emotivoice_TTS

A simple extension that can make model's output text-to-speach by Emotivoice (Chinese-English Bilingual by NetEase).

This model is super fast, usually cost only <0.2 sec for a ~20 words sentence on 3090 with ~1GB VRAM occupation.

<https://github.com/yhyu13/Emotivoice_TTS>

## Session_Manager

UI for saving/loading data and parameters between sessions, periodic autosaving

<https://github.com/bekkayya/session_manager/>

## XTTSv2

A variant of the coqui_tts extension in the main repository. Both use the XTTSv2 model, but this one has a "narrator" feature for text written \*between asterisks\*.

<https://github.com/kanttouchthis/text_generation_webui_xtts>

## Echoproof

Injects recent conversation history into the negative prompt with the goal of minimizing the LLM's tendency to fixate on a single word, phrase, or sentence structure. Provides controls for optimizing the results.

<https://github.com/ThereforeGames/echoproof>

## bark_tts

A simple implementation of Suno-AI's Bark Text-To-Speech with implicit multi-language and simple sound effect support.

The owner of the original extension has not had the time to maintain it. I have forked it to make it compatible with the current state of Oobabooga's textgen-webui and have improved/modified the text output that the AI reads to prevent errors with special character recognition.

(forked from the original and no longer maintained <https://github.com/minemo/text-generation-webui-barktts>)

<https://github.com/RandomInternetPreson/text-generation-webui-barktts>
