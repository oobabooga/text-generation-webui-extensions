## api_advanced

An expanded version of api extension.
1. Provide Kobold-like interface (the same way as "api" classic extension)
2. **Provide advanced logic to auto-translate income prompts:**
    - You need to use multi_translate extension: https://github.com/janvarev/multi_translate
    - Set up param `'is_advanced_translation': True`, (set by default)
    - ...see the details in console
      - Due to advanced logic script splits income prompt by lines, and **cache translation results**
      - **Text quality feature:** when it generate English response, it cache it too (so you don't do double-translation English->UserLang->English next time)
