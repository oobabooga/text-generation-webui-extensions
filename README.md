## Virtual Lora

State of the Art Lora Management - Custom Collections, Checkpoints, Notes & Detailed Info

If you're anything like me (and if you've made 500 LORAs, chances are you are), a decent management system becomes *essential*. This allows you to set up multiple LORA 'collections', each containing one or more virtually named subfolders into which you can sort all those adapters you've been building for weeks; and add any notes about the LORAs or checkpoints. You can of course apply the LORAs or any of the checkpoints directly.  It's a finer grained enhancement than Playground's Lora-rama, but it will be concentrating solely on LORAs and nothing else.

https://github.com/FartyPants/VirtualLora

## api_advanced

An expanded version of api extension.
1. Provide Kobold-like interface (the same way as "api" classic extension)
2. **Provide advanced logic to auto-translate income prompts:**
    - You need to use multi_translate extension: https://github.com/janvarev/multi_translate
    - Set up param `'is_advanced_translation': True`, (set by default)
    - ...see the details in console
      - Due to advanced logic script splits income prompt by lines, and **cache translation results**
      - **Text quality feature:** when it generate English response, it cache it too (so you don't do double-translation English->UserLang->English next time) 

https://github.com/janvarev/api_advanced

## voicevox_tts
A simple extension that can make model's output text-to-speach by voicevox.
It also can make model's output auto translate to Japanese before it process by voicevox.

https://github.com/asadfgglie/voicevox_tts

## bark_tts

A simple implementation of Suno-AI's Bark Text-To-Speech with implicit multi-language and simple sound effect support.

The owner of the original extension has not had the time to maintain it.  I have forked it to make it compatible with the current state of Oobabooga's textgen-webui and have improved/modified the text output that the AI reads to prevent errors with special character recognition.

https://github.com/RandomInternetPreson/text-generation-webui-barktts

(forked from the original and no longer maintained https://github.com/minemo/text-generation-webui-barktts)

## Twinbook
This extension combines chat and notebook in a very clever way. It's based on my above extension (Playground) but very streamlined for only Generation/Continue but with a little twist. You are in full control of both sides - the instruction side (left) and the result side (right) allowing you to steer LLM in the middle of text (or even sentence) by simply changing the instructions on left and clicking Continue on right.
For more trips how to use it, read the README

https://github.com/FartyPants/Twinbook

## More translators  
This extension adds a lot more translators to choose from, including Baidu, Google, Bing, DeepL and so on.  
Need to run `pip install --upgrade translators` first.

https://github.com/SnowMasaya/text-generation-webui/tree/deepl/extensions/deepl_translate
